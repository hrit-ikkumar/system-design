### Basic Things about Design Patterns 
1. A design patterns are well-proved solution for solving the specific problem/task.
2. a design pattern represents an idea, not a particular implementation.
3. By using the design patterns you can make your code more flexible, reusable and maintainable.
4. It is the most important part because java internally follows design patterns.

### Advantage of using Design Patterns
1. They are reusable in multiple projects.
2. They provide the solutions that help to define the system architecture.
3. They capture the software engineering experiences.
4. They provide transparency to the design of an application.
5. They are well-proved and testified solutions since they have been built upon the knowledge and experience of expert software developers.
6. Design patterns don?t guarantee an absolute solution to a problem. They provide clarity to the system architecture and the possibility of building a better system.

### When to use Design patterns
   We must use the design patterns `during the analysis and requirement phase of SDLC`
