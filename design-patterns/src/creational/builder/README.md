# Builder Design Pattern

1. This design pattern is used to create object based on available properties.
2. For example, a car can have different features in it but all car doesn't require them
3. It reduces complexity of creation of constructor based on optional properties. 
4. It also help us to create immutable objects. 

### Example in Java
        StringBuilder, CharBuffer, ByteBuffer
