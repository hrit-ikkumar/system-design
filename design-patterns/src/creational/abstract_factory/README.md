# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

1. It is used to create objects based on types.
2. It is similar to simple factory/factory method but the difference is it uses multiple products type to make different-2 concrete implementation of factory.
3. Concrete factories can be singleton as well
4. Abstract factory means abstraction on factories. We can have multiple forms of factories 

`xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory is one of example in java`

`java.util.prefs.PreferencesFactory is one of the example of Abastract factory`
