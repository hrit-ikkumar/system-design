# SOLID Principle
- ##### S: Single Responsibility:
    -       Only one responsibility for a class.
        
        A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
- ##### O: Open-Closed: 
    -       Open for extension but closed for modification
        
        the module should be open for extension but closed for modification
- ##### L: Liskov Substitution: 
    -       Child Class should be substitutable by its Parent Classes
        Developer should not be under-impression that he is updating a different object
- ##### I: Interface Segregation: 
    -       the larger interfaces split into smaller ones
        If there can be multiple sub-groups of interfaces then we should divide them
- ##### D: Dependency Inversion: 
    -       high / low level modules' details depend upon abstraction
        high level modules should not depend on low level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details.  Details should depend upon abstractions
#### WHY SOLID:
  - To develop software with considerations for maintaining and extending as the project grows.
  - To avoiding code smells, refactoring code, and Agile or Adaptive software development

Tips: Don't use '-' in package name
