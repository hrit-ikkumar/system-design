# SOLID Principle
- ##### S: Single Responsibility:
    -       Only one responsibility for a class.
        
        A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
- ##### O: Open-Closed: 
    -       Open for extension but closed for modification
        
        the module should be open for extension but closed for modification
- ##### I: Interface Segregation: 
- ##### L: Liskov Substitution: 
- ##### D: Dependency Inversion: 

#### WHY SOLID:
  - To develop software with considerations for maintaining and extending as the project grows.
  - To avoiding code smells, refactoring code, and Agile or Adaptive software development
