# 1.Creational Design Pattern
   - Builder Pattern: To build complex objects
   - Simple Factory: To create objects based on type
   - Factory Pattern/ Factory Method Pattern: Similar to simple factory just a method to create object
   - Abstract Factory Pattern: Abstraction on factories to create multiple implementation for multiple products' combination
   - Prototype Pattern: Clone of object (Implement Clonable interface)
   - Singleton Pattern: Single copy (Lazy or Eager)

`Creational design patterns are concerned with the way of creating objects`
