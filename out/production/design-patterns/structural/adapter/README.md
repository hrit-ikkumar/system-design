# Adapter/Wrapper Design Pattern
`Allows two incompatible objects to make compatible. Helps to connect two in-compatible objects/interface`
1. When two different layers of architecture of application interacts through adapter.
2. For example service with database. There will be a adapter to plug them.
3. When we have existing object but client code is expecting a different object.there we need adapter
4. Adapter makes two interfaces which are not compatible to compatible

`InputStreamReader is one of the example for Adapter Design Pattern`
